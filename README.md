## Introduction
This repository build an demo of Image Depestimation in Stereo Matching. 

We use two data set Tsukuba and Aloe
## Installation
### 1. Clone the repository  
```
git clone https://github.com/thehaodev/image-depth-estimation.git
```
### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment 
```
py -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
### 3. Install the required dependencies 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage example
We will use two different method, one is pixel-wise-matching and pixel-window-base-matching. 
With each method we'll vectorize to boost the process

This is example result of pixel-wise-matching
